queueueue-counter
===============

This package is a simple counter. It simulates a queue management systems display, those number boards counting up until it is your turn. 

![Example](http://github.com/arkascha/queueueue-counter/raw/master/doc/snapshot-1.jpg)

## Purpose
The package was developed as part of a longer running project and serves testing purposes. This is why its counting logic and optical appearance both can be tuned in a flexible manner. The technical approach is an in-page app running in a web browser. It can be served by a web server but does not require such. It is fine to just open the top level index.html page from within the local file system.

## Features
- general purpose counter (counting up only)
- variable counting parameters: base sleep period and potential variant, manual, automatic or API based triggering
- flexible control of the optical design by means of handles right inside the display
- fullscreen mode
- please note that there is _no_ storage feature implemented!

## Installation
Just grab the zip package offered for download on github where the package lives (https://github.com/arkascha/queueue-counter/archive/master.zip). Unpack it into the local file system or the document storeage of an http server and navigate a web browser to its top level index.html file. 

## Disclaimer
Since the package serves only testing purposes only a limited amount of time has been invested into the implementation. Therefore quality, completness and style of the implementation certainly hold potential for enhancements. No guarantee of any form is granted that this package works as described, expected or required.
